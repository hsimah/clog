/**
 * Resolves edges, and remembers what it has already resolved.
 *
 * Two distinct savings, worth separating because they are often confused.
 *
 * **Laziness** is free: an edge accessor returns a query, so traversing a graph costs
 * nothing until something is asked of it.
 *
 * **Batching** is not free, and cannot be retrofitted onto a call that has already
 * happened. Once fifty posts have each been asked for their comments one at a time,
 * fifty queries have run. Genuine batching needs a caller that knows all fifty ids up
 * front — a GraphQL resolver does, which is why preload() exists and is called there
 * rather than guessed at here.
 *
 * Between the two sits the identity map: asking the same post for its comments twice
 * costs one query, not two.
