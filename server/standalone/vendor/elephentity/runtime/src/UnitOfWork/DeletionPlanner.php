/**
 * Turns "delete this row" into everything that entails.
 *
 * Walks the edges that point at the row, applies each policy, and recurses where one
 * says cascade — a Post taking its Comments with it, and each Comment taking whatever
 * depends on *it*.
 *
 * Two things the walk has to survive. Cycles: Post cascades to Comment, Comment
 * cascades back to Post, and without a visited set that runs until the stack gives
 * out. And ordering: dependents are deleted before the row they depend on, so a
 * foreign key never dangles even briefly.
