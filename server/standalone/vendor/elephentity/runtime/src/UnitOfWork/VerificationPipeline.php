/**
 * Runs verification over a mutation and collects everything that failed.
 *
 * Presence comes first, because it is about the mutation rather than a value: a create
 * missing a required field is rejected here, before any SQL runs. Without it the
 * omission reaches the database and the outcome depends on the installation — a strict
 * MySQL raises an error, and WordPress's default session quietly stores
 * `0000-00-00 00:00:00` instead.
 *
 * Then the two value tiers. The field verifier runs first — it is entity-specific and
 * exactly typed — and then the shared type processor. **Both run even when the first
 * fails**, so violations from the two tiers arrive together rather than the second
 * being discovered only after the first is fixed.
 *
 * Nothing throws. The unit of work decides what to do with a non-empty result.
