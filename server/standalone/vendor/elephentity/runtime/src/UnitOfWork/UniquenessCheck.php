/**
 * Asks whether a value marked `unique:` is already taken.
 *
 * Without it a duplicate is a raw SQL exception — the driver's message, the statement
 * that produced it, and an index name no caller has ever heard of. Compare what
 * `onDelete: restrict` produces, which names the entity, the count and the edge. A
 * uniqueness failure is the same kind of fact and deserves the same kind of answer, so
 * it becomes a Violation with a field path and joins whatever else the commit found
 * wrong.
 *
 * **The index is still the guarantee.** This runs before the transaction opens, so two
 * concurrent creates can both pass it and one will still fail on the constraint. That
 * is the right division: the check makes the ordinary case a good error, and the
 * database keeps being right about the race.
