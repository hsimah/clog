 * Everything the runtime needs to know about entities, addressed by name.

 * entity, what an edge points at, which field carries a declared type. The runtime has
 * no schema and should not gain one — the IR is a build-time artefact and loading it
 * per request would be paying for compilation twice.
 *
 * Implementations resolve generated classes through the application's container rather
 * than taking dozens of constructor arguments, so adding an entity does not widen a
