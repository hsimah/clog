 * The spec declares the bespoke unit, the generator emits its interface, and the
 * application supplies the class. Until it does, the application does not start.
 *
 * Boot time rather than call time, so a missing handler cannot lurk in production
 * until the wrong request arrives; and boot rather than generate time, so codegen
 * stays a pure function of the spec and never has to scan application code.
 *
 * Every missing implementation is listed at once — fixing them one exception at a
 * time would be needlessly slow.
