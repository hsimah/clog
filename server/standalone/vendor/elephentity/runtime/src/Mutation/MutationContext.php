 * verifier can compare a value against the original or against another field — the
 * cross-field rules a per-value processor could not otherwise express.
 *
 * Every verifier runs against the same final pending state rather than incrementally
 * as setters fire, so ordering does not matter and two fields can validate against
 * each other symmetrically.
 *
 * Values are domain-typed (TOut) on both sides: write() has not run at verify time,
 * and originals come from the hydrated entity.
 *
 * Access is stringly-typed here because a shared processor such as Money is used by
 * many entities and cannot accept a generated per-entity context. Rules that want
 * exact types belong in a field verifier, whose generated interface names both the
 * entity and the field's domain type.
