/**
 * The opaque identifier a Node hands out, and the row id hiding inside it.
 *
 * `id: 12` is unique to a table and not to a schema, so a client with a normalised
 * cache files a Post and an Author of the same row number in one place and serves the
 * wrong one. The Node interface exists to stop exactly that, and the price of
 * implementing it is that the type name has to travel with the id.
 *
 * The shape is WPGraphQL's: `base64(loaderKey:id)`, split at the first colon. What
 * WPGraphQL calls the loader key is a single constant here rather than the type name,
 * because AppContext builds a loader from a class name alone — there is no constructor
 * through which a shared class could be told which type it was registered for, and a
 * generated loader class per entity would be one more tree to keep in step with the
 * spec. So the key says only "this is ours", and the type name is the next segment.
