/**
 * One field on a GraphQL object type.
 *
 * `accessor` is the whole convention: a spec field named `title` becomes a GraphQL
 * field `title` resolved by calling `getTitle()` on the read model. Because the
 * generator produced both ends from the same spec, the two cannot drift — and the
 * conformance check can prove it by comparing this manifest against the entity class.
 *
 * `encoding` completes it. The accessor returns a domain value and the client was
 * promised a wire type; whoever decided the wire type is the only thing that can say
 * how to get there, so it is recorded here rather than guessed at in the resolver.
