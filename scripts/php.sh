# There is no host PHP and generation needs 8.3, so this is how the eleph commands
# get run. It is deliberately not part of docker-compose.yml: generating code is a
# build step and must not require the runtime stack to be up. The container is
# removed on exit (--rm) and podman has no daemon, so nothing is left running.
#
# The working directory inside the container is `server/`, which is where eleph.json
# lives and where every command in the build loop is run from.
